The \nonNotFound\n of ESP8266WebServer/WebServer does not work with AutoConnect. AutoConnect overrides \nESP8266WebServer::onNotFound\n/\nWebServer::onNotFound\n to handle a captive portal. To register \"not found\" handler, use \nAutoConnect::onNotFound\n.\n\n\n Automatic reconnect\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhen the captive portal is started, SoftAP starts and the STA is disconnected. The current SSID setting memorized in ESP8266 will be lost but then the reconnect behavior of ESP32 is somewhat different from this.\n\nThe \nWiFiSTAClass::disconnect\n function implemented in the arduino-esp32 has extended parameters than the ESP8266's arduino-core. The second parameter of WiFi.disconnect on the arduino-esp32 core that does not exist in the \nESP8266WiFiSTAClass\n has the effect of deleting the currently connected WiFi configuration and its default value is \"false\". On the ESP32 platform, even if WiFi.disconnect is executed, WiFi.begin() without the parameters in the next turn will try to connect to that AP. That is, automatic reconnection is implemented in arduino-esp32 already. Although this behavior appears seemingly competent, it is rather a disadvantage in scenes where you want to change the access point each time. When explicitly disconnecting WiFi from the Disconnect menu, AutoConnect will erase the AP connection settings saved by arduino-esp32 core. AutoConnect's automatic reconnection is a mechanism independent from the automatic reconnection of the arduino-esp32 core.\n\nIf the \nautoReconnect\n option of the \nAutoConnectConfig\n class is enabled, it automatically attempts to reconnect to the disconnected past access point. When the autoReconnect option is specified, AutoConnect will not start SoftAP immediately if the first WiFi.begin fails. It will scan WiFi signal and the same connection information as the detected BSSID is stored in EEPROM as AutoConnect's credentials, explicitly apply it with WiFi.begin and rerun.\n\n\nAutoConnect\n       \nPortal\n;\n\n\nAutoConnectConfig\n \nConfig\n;\n\n\nConfig\n.\nautoReconnect\n \n=\n \ntrue\n;\n\n\nPortal\n.\nconfig\n(\nConfig\n);\n\n\nPortal\n.\nbegin\n();\n\n\n\n\n\nAn autoReconnect option is available to \nAutoConnect::begin\n without SSID and pass passphrase.\n\n\n Auto save Credential\n\u00b6\n\n\nBy default, AutoConnect saves the credentials of the established connection in EEPROM.

ESP-IDF saves the WiFi connection configuration to NVS, but AutoConnect stores it on the eeprom partition. You can find the partition table for default as \ndefault.csv\n\n\n\n\n Captive portal start detection\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe captive portal will only be activated if the first \nWiFi::begin\n fails.

The second parameter of WiFi.disconnect on the arduino-esp32 core that does not exist in the  ESP8266WiFiSTAClass  has the effect of deleting the currently connected WiFi configuration and its default value is \"false\". On the ESP32 platform, even if WiFi.disconnect is executed, WiFi.begin() without the parameters in the next turn will try to connect to that AP. That is, automatic reconnection is implemented in arduino-esp32 already. Although this behavior appears seemingly competent, it is rather a disadvantage in scenes where you want to change the access point each time. When explicitly disconnecting WiFi from the Disconnect menu, AutoConnect will erase the AP connection settings saved by arduino-esp32 core. AutoConnect's automatic reconnection is a mechanism independent from the automatic reconnection of the arduino-esp32 core. \nIf the  autoReconnect  option of the  AutoConnectConfig  class is enabled, it automatically attempts to reconnect to the disconnected past access point. When the autoReconnect option is specified, AutoConnect will not start SoftAP immediately if the first WiFi.begin fails.

AutoConnect          portal ;  AutoConnectConfig    Config ;  Config . staip   =   IPAddress ( 192 , 168 , 1 , 10 );  Config . staGateway   =   IPAddress ( 192 , 168 , 1 , 1 );  Config . staNetmask   =   IPAddress ( 255 , 255 , 255 , 0 );  Config . dns1   =   IPAddress ( 192 , 168 , 1 , 1 );  portal . config ( Config );  portal . begin ();       Static IP address assignment is available from version 0.9.3.\u00a0 \u21a9",

It has advantages for something WiFi client as well. For example, AutoConnect is also effective for publishing MQTT messages from various measurement points. Even if the SSID is different for each measurement point, it is not necessary to modify the sketch.\n\n\nThis example tries to publish the WiFi signal strength of ESP8266 with MQTT. It uses the \nThingSpeak\n for MQTT broker. ESP8266 publishes the RSSI value to the channel created on ThingSpeak as \nMQTT client\n. This example is well suited to demonstrate the usefulness of AutoConnect, as RSSI values are measured at each access point usually. Just adding a few lines of code makes it unnecessary to upload sketches with the different SSIDs rewrite for each access point.\n\n\n\n\nAdvance procedures\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nArduino Client for MQTT - It's the \nPubSubClient\n, install it to Arduino IDE.

ThingSpeak has the free plan for the account which uses within the scope of this example.\n1\n You can sign up with the \nThingSpeak sign-up page\n.\n\n\n\n\nWhether you should do sign-up or not.\n\n\nYou are entrusted with the final judgment of account creation for ThingSpeak.

The API key required to publish the message is the \nWrite API Key\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe last key you need is the \nUser API Key\n and can be confirmed it in the user profile. Pull down \nAccount\n from the top menu, select \nMy profile\n.
